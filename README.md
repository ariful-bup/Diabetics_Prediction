# Diabetics_Prediction
Prediction of early diabetes using an XGBoost classifier and explaining the influence of the attributes on the metaheuristic algorithm.
Diabetes is a serious health problem for millions of people around the world every year. By analyzing the symptoms, physical characteristics, and laboratory test values of patients in their medical records, it is possible to identify patterns or features that are not easily detected by conventional medical methods. In this study, we proposed a machine learning-based model for detecting diabetes in its early stages. In this study, we used a new type of wrapper-based feature selection method, which employs the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to reduce the number of input features. In addition, we compared the performance of our method with conventional machine learning algorithms such as the XGBoost classifier. The XGB classifier without optimization, the baseline model, achieved 97% accuracy. The results showed that our proposed method is not only able to work with fewer features but also able to predict with greater accuracy (97.26% accuracy using XGB_WOA). The results of this study may be useful in the future medical field and may become a useful auxiliary tool for doctors.
